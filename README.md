# MTX Operating System
This project was done for my operating systems class. It was a partner project. 

This project's purpose was to create an operating system that functioned like a basic Linux system. It could read and write to a virtual disk. 

I was responsible for implementing file permissions, writing some of the OS intialization code, and the following commands:
* mount
* umount
* move
* chmod
* write
* close
* lseek
* unlink
* readlink
* touch 
* stat
* creat
* mkdir
* ls
* cd
* pwd
